## About The Project
This is a Basic ecommerce application to demostrate simple activities like view product on the home page, adding product to cart, viewing product details, viewing cart and implementing a simple checkout with paystack.
I try to keep everything simple and just follow what is on the [figma Design](https://www.figma.com/proto/MSyCAqVy1UgNap0pvqH6H3/Junior-Frontend-Test-Designs-(Public)?type=design&node-id=150-5&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1), I used NGXS state management tool to manage the shopping cart and currency.

## Tools and Tech Stack

- The frontend is pretty basic and it is built with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) to match the figma design. It is a simple app but [NGXS](https://ngxs.io) state management was used to manage the shopping cart state.


## getting Started

To set up this project on you local you will have to do the following:

**1.** `git clone https://github.com/shiftback3/simple-angular-shopping-app.git` you will notice that you have a folder `simple-angular-shopping-app`.

```

```

ng serve -o 
```
to run the application and it will open at http://localhost:4200.
 ## Test
 No unit test was written, but a basic e2e test with Cypress just to make sure the expected home page loads, nothing complex on the test. To run the e2e test use 
 ```
 ng e2e

 ```
